Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing a Pizza Sales Dataset using SQL to uncover insights about sales performance, customer preferences, and revenue patterns. The database contains multiple tables, including order details, pizza information, categories, and pricing.

By writing SQL queries, the project explores sales trends across different dimensions such as time, category, and pizza type. It also applies advanced analytical techniques like cumulative revenue calculation and percentage contribution analysis.
